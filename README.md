SQL Project : Grocery Store Sales

FoodYum is a grocery store chain that is based in the United States.
Food Yum sells items such as produce, meat, dairy, baked goods, snacks, and other household food staples.
As food costs rise, FoodYum wants to make sure it keeps stocking products in all categories that cover a range of prices to ensure they have stock for a broad range of customers.


**In this project I performed,**

Identifying Missing Data: Encountered the challenge of identifying products with missing year_added values. This experience highlighted the significance of data completeness and its implications on pricing strategies.

Data Validation Query: Engaged in creating a query that validated the product data against expected standards without modifying the original dataset. This reinforced the concept of data stewardship and responsible data handling.

Analyzing Product Types: Conducted a range analysis for product types, gaining insight into how to utilize aggregate functions like MIN and MAX. This task emphasized the need for comprehensive data analysis in understanding product performance.

Targeted Sales Analysis: Focused on a specific subset of products (meat and dairy) and their sales performance, allowing for a detailed exploration of average units sold. This experience underscored the importance of targeted analysis in deriving actionable business insights.

Overall, these tasks contributed to a robust understanding of data management, SQL proficiency, and the analytical processes necessary to inform business decisions effectively.
